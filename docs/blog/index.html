  We made everything too complicated. We do this, us developers. It&rsquo;s fun to invent a new and better way to do things. And to use all the &ldquo;new things&rdquo;. But I think this is the time to stop and think about what we are doing. One of those things is treating every website like an app - although most sites are nothing of the sort.
The web was designed for documents The World Wide Web (www) was designed to be a collection of documents that could be linked together.

    <h2><a href='/blog/rum-with-elk/'> Web vitals real user monitoring with Elasticsearch and Kibana</a> </h2>

  Elasticsearch is awesome. I had it on my &ldquo;things to learn&rdquo; list for quite a while, and I finally got to it when an ecommerce site I&rsquo;m working on needed some real user monitoring (RUM) to make sure performance stays superb. This is the story of how easy this was to set up with Elasticsearch and Kibana (ELK - or at least EK).
Web vitals is a term for some new metrics surrounding site usability.
