<p>Google Cast is pretty cool. Especially Chromecast, of course. You can cast pretty much any media
on this super cheap device. But even better, you can build your own apps that run on the Chromecast.</p>
<p>To build an app, you need to create:</p>
<ul>
<li>A &ldquo;sender&rdquo; app which controls the casting</li>
<li>A &ldquo;receiver&rdquo; app that runs on the Chromecast</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, to test all of this in development, you need to register your device for development (super easy!).</p>

    <h1 id="simple-text-editor">Simple text editor</h1>
<p>This is a test of the Filesystem API. It&rsquo;s a very simple text editor. Use at your own risk&hellip; 😏</p>
<p>The Filesystem API is freaking amazing. With it you can magically open <em>local</em> files and also save them back!
The API is in &ldquo;Origin trial&rdquo; from Chrome 78 onwards, and available as a flag in previous versions.</p>
<p>The API is pretty damn cool, if you ask me. This is a quite nice looking text editor with a contenteditable
<code>pre</code> tag, and the code is not many lines long. Soon the days of native desktop apps are over! 😝</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Google Cloud Platform project with Calendar API enabled</li>
<li>API key and OAuth client for the project</li>
<li>Private top-level domain for hosting (see note below)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: You need to authorize the OAuth client for a particular URL.
This URL needs to be on a whitelisted domain, which in turn needs
to be a private top-level domain.</p>
<p>This project also showcases using Google Sign-In to request for
additional permissions on demand (incremental authorization). Note
that it&rsquo;s apparently not possible to bypass the account selection
when doing this.</p>
<p><strong>The Calendar API is restricted and requires validation by Google
before usage. It still works without validation, but shows a very
scary warning.</strong></p>
