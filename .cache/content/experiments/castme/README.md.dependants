But even better, you can build your own apps that run on the Chromecast.</p>\n<p>To build an app, you need to create:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A &quot;sender&quot; app which controls the casting</li>\n<li>A &quot;receiver&quot; app that runs on the Chromecast</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, to test all of this in development, you need to register your device for development (super easy!).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/developers\">Docs</a></p>\n"
