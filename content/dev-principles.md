There is only one:

> Focus on quality

Quality means usability, it means performance, and it means responsiveness. It means building the foundation right, and continuing to improve on the foundation.

I believe quality (and most notably "performance") leads to better results. What is more, it leads to a better Web for everyone.

1. What is the most important "quality" metric?
2. What is the most important user metric?

There will come a time when you want to implement some new and shiny thing that can be embedded on your page in five minutes. I will resist this until the end. Nothing is more important than your "business", of course. But your business objective is not "embed this new product recommendation engine", but rather "make it easier for people to find and buy products they want". However, if we together can objectively show (with data), that "new product recommendation engine" makes your site better (in terms of user metric and/or quality metric), then we do it!
