I like to code. And I like to develop new things. Mostly I develop for the web - products and services for myself or for others, and open source tools for different scenarios.

### Coding

I believe code should do exactly what it's supposed to do - not more, not less. On the web in particular, this means avoiding bloated libraries and crazy Stack Overflow -hacks.

> The web is built on well implemented standards - use them.

### Entrepreneurship

I'm an entrepreneur at heart. This means that I always think about why I develop what I develop. This applies as much to my work with clients as my own solutions.

> Test early and often because it's fun and effective.

## Projects

I'm open for client work. Hit me up and let's see if we're a match!

### Privacy-first static site hosting

I'm building a static site hosting service that doesn't track anyone at all. Not even IP addresses are logged. All servers are in Europe, which is of course great for GDPR.

### TypeScript static site generator

`bob` is a TypeScript static site generator based on the awesome [Deno](https://deno.land) runtime. But it's also so much more - TSX server functions and generator-based content importing out of the box. And incremental builds for extremely fast content updates.

### Static eCommerce frontend for retail

I started the transformation to a static eCommerce frontend for a Finnish retailer, building the first version that ran successfully for many years. Our views have since diverged a bit, but the original idea still lives strong. Separating the backend (e.g. Shopify) from the frontend (e.g. static site) has many advantages, and this is still the architecture in use.

### Finnish Baby Box

I co-founded a company selling a starter package for new parents. What a ride it was! On the technical side, I developed and managed the our custom-built ecommerce solution. We sold the business to a Finnish childwear company, where Finnish Baby Box now has a new home.

### Humla

I tried every todo app out there and finally decided to make my own that works the way I want. Active users: 3.
