title: Moonlander Split Mechanical Keyboard Review
---

I have a [Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-ultimate/),
which is a great keyboard. It's a mechanical keyboard - like every keyboard
should be - and it makes a lot of noise. However, I've been playing with the
idea of a split keyboard, which would be super cool ... *ehm* productive and
ergonomic. Luckily, one of my friends over at the [Knackeriet](https://www.knackeriet.se/)
co-working space recently got one, and he let me borrow it for a few days. Here
are my thoughts.

## Why the Moonlander landed on my radar

There's a lot to like about the Moonlander. It's fully configurable for one
(QMK firmware). Pretty much my only complaint with the Das Keyboard is that it's
*just* a keyboard. All the cool kids do home key mods, tap-dances, layers, mouse
moving, and so on. And I'm stuck with just changing my keyboard layout.

The Moonlander is also column staggered, meaning that the keys are arranged in
columns rather than rows (look at the image and you'll get it). Easier on the
hands? Perhaps. More productive? I hope. Cooler? You bet!

Finally, the obvious one: it's a split keyboard. There really is no need to put
your hands right next to each other when writing. Especially since you're all
doing touch typing on a blank keyboard.

## It really delivers, but...

The Moonlander really delivers on all the things it's supposed to. Configuring
it is a breeze, it looks really cool, and it generally feels like high quality
product. It is exactly what you think you're getting - no disappointments there.
But is that really what I want?

## ... what it delivers is not for me

I started out with a completely crazy keyboard layout with something like 15
layers to keep track of. (There is an abundance of user-created layouts
available and I just picked one pretty much at random.) It even had a layer just
to change layers. Now is probably a good time to say that a layer is when you
change some or all of the keys to mean something different. /r/mechkeyboards
would probably kill me for saying this, but it's kind of like the shift key but
with on completely crazy amounts of steroids.

The thing is, configurability is not good on its own. In fact, I think it's
pretty much the opposite. I like to keep to standards and simplicity, and the
layout I actually ended up with is eerily similar to my regular keyboard layout.
So while I'd still like a QMK keyboard, this went way down on my list of things
I want.

Also the columnar layout was a bit of a bust. I kept hitting the wrong keys
and whatnot. Given a few more days and my own preference of switches (different
types have a different feel to them), I'm sure it'd get better. But I realized
I'm used to the normal row staggered layout. And the biggest reason for columnar
keyboards is arguably ergonomics - and after switching to Dvorak (from the usual
qwerty), my hands are fine.

Finally, the layout is a bit weird. The thumb keys are hard. This is of course a
feature and not a bug, but it's way more difficult to suddenly start hitting
enter with your thumb than you'd think. It ditches some keys, like the function
keys and the last column of keys on the right pinky. But it adds not only the
thumb keys, but also a column for your index fingers and keys on the bottom row
(this, of course, is a result of it being columnar). So it really doesn't feel
very minimal or compact. Or cool, if I really think about it.

*Side note on backlighted keys: I've never had this, and always thought it was
a gimmick. I can tell you that's exactly what it is. =D There is of course the
legitimate use case of coloring different layers and different types of keys in
different colors. But if you need to do that, then your keyboard is too
complicated. At least from a productivity standpoint.*

## Conclusion

The Moonlander is an amazing keyboard, from what I've experienced. It's just not
for me. Next on my list is an [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/).
It's more familiar, more compact, and should be everything I'm looking for. But
for now, I'm again extremely happy with my Das Keyboard.
